          <p>The Steering Committee's purpose is to ensure the IPFS project's success.</p>
<h2>Meetings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every 2 weeks</li>
<li>File issues at https://github.com/ipfs/steering-wg.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Inaugural Setup</h2>
<p>An important task of the Steering Committee is to support or establish democratic governance of
the IPFS project by the IPFS community. However, before that can happen we need a bootstrap phase
so as to define how the governance will work and to set up the infrastructure it needs. That is
the first, provisional Steering Committee that is working to get itself out of power.</p>
<p>The provisional Steering Committee has 7 seats, all of them appointed by fiat by community leaders.
As of February 2024, four of these had been seated and we are actively working to seat the remaining
three.</p>
<p>For institutional continuity, and in order to have staggered elections, three of those seats are for
two-year terms (ending 2026-02-28) and the other four are one-year terms (ending 2025-02-28). If the
governance system we pick has term limits for the Steering Committee, the two-year terms will count
towards the term limits but the one-year terms will not.</p>
<p>The first election for the Steering Committee will take place after one year (in early 2025). That election
will replace (or reseat) the one-year terms. The second election will take place the follow year for
the remaining seats. At that point the Steering Committee will no longer be provisional.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The Steering Committee is tasked with defining, evolving, and defending the non-technical mission
and values of the IPFS Project. For instance, this includes taking positions on the impact of given
policies on IPFS or working with adjacent projects to strengthen a shared vision of a robust,
decentralized, and democratic internet.</p>
<p>We are also tasked with overall strategy for the IPFS project. We are not in a position to tell
IPFS teams what to do, so this isn't strategy in the corporate sense. Rather, we gather input from
people in the community ‚Äî never hesitate to reach out! ‚Äî and pay attention to developments in the
wider world and try to combine these into a clear set of objectives that we believe can drive a
thriving and growing IPFS ecosystem. Our goal is for that strategy to be credible and attractive
enough, and aligned enough with community hopes and needs, that people in the community will
<em>want</em> to help make it a reality.</p>
<p>We design governance for key parts of the IPFS ecosystem and help others establish their own
governance systems. We own and support the Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Finally, we identify funding sources that could benefit the IPFS ecosystem and we apply for
grants that can then be deployed to support the work of the community.</p>
