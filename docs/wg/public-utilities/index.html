<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The PUWG is tasked with making the hard decisions about IPFS infrastructure that is funded as
public goods (e.g. public gateways or Amino/mainnet bootstrappers). Everyday operational and
development decisions should be made by operators and developers directly. But more elaborate
questions that require coordination and some degree of consensus across the ecosystem are
referred to this group. For example, this could include support for big blocks, blocking video,
or nudges to the ecosystem such as pushing for subdomain gatewaying.</p>
<p>For the time being, this groups is comprised of people who are directly working on these systems
or involved in community governance. Our intent is to gradually set it up with an open governance
system.</p>
