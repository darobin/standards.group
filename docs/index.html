          <p>The <strong>standards.group</strong> does what no one else in their right mind wants to do: it sets a standard
for standards. The goal is to define the moving parts of standards well enough that whenever groups
of people need to get together to agree on a simple standard, they can adopt the tools, resources,
processes, etc. defined here and not have to worry about reinventing the wheel.</p>
<p>Our approach is designed to pare down what you need to operate as a potentially-credible standard
(or pre-standard, if you want to incubate a specification and then take it to an established
organization) to the strict minimum. If you see something here which you believe you won't need,
think twice: the odds are that you <em>will</em> need it, you just haven't had that problem yet.</p>
<p>In addition to that, we maintain a list of groups that operate according to the tooling and
processes which we maintain and that abide by a shared set of principles. Projects that seek to
increase decentralization (which is the goal of any digital standard worthy of the name) tend to
lack a shared place to find one another. The list we provide is not &quot;official&quot; by any means ‚Äî it's
not entirely clear who would have the authority to establish an official list in a decentralized
world ‚Äî but it offers a way for these groups to discover one another and potentially to coordinate.</p>
